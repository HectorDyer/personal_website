I will create a large-scale installation of woven fabric that explores these narratives. I plan for 5-8 panels, each 3-4 metres long. Each panel will be woven in patterns and techniques of different weaving societies, alongside scenes, text and imagery which tell the narratives. I will use appliqu√© and embroidery to add detail to these scenes. The panels will also feature pieces the participants make in workshops.
The panels will be suspended from broken / discarded pieces of old looms to create a shelter-like structure that visitors can enter into. It will be a cocoon of threads, colour and imagery that can be touched.
